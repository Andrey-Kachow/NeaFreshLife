# NeaFreshLife
Python Django Website about Nutrition and Fitness.
Was my A-Level Non-Examined Assessment (NEA) project, more information on which can be found or soon will be available on my website.
`andreypopov.xyz`.
After completing the project in late 2018, An attempt was made to redesign and extend it, but the lack of version control and my beginner computing skills at that time and also being busy studying,
the project was partially broken and left incomplete.
Future plans for the codebase are to fix the bugs and turn it into MVP that could be merged with my main website.
Or alternatively, be hosted independently, just to be alive.

As an A-Level NEA, it is my first project that made me feel like a developer, not just a programmer.
Therefore I am proud of that, though the officially submitted version is lost and the only thing I have is a broken incomplete rebranded version.
